The guide will follow procedures available in the R package spsurvey and R code to implement most stages of a statistical survey process. To assist non-R users, the guide will also offer screenshots of available R shiny applications which do not require coding experience. These applications are housed on an EPA server and can be accessed using an internet browser. Topics which will be covered in this document include: Statistical Survey Design Sampling Weights Condition Estimates of a Population Visualizing Estimates "],["background.html", "Background Statistical Survey National Aquatic Resource Surveys Monitoring Initiative Funds", " Background Statistical Survey Ideally, an organization would survey an entire population, otherwise known as a census, to perfectly reflect the condition of a resource. However, this is rarely possible and organizations are forced to implement a Statistical Survey (Probabilistic) Design to randomly select a subset of the population to reduce the cost and effort. When implemented correctly, a statistical survey can be an effective method for assessing the condition of a broad population with a known confidence. National Aquatic Resource Surveys The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has utilized statistical survey designs in the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS). NARS provides statistically valid national assessments of the condition of the nations waters (streams and rivers, lakes, coastal waters, and wetlands). Monitoring Initiative Funds Monitoring Initiative funds are allocated to states, eligible interstate agencies, and eligible tribes using a formula that targets funds to enhance monitoring strategies and develop statistically valid reports on water condition. EPA, states and other partners collaborate to design the National Aquatic Resource Surveys, which cover the continental United States. For each sampling site selected through the survey design that falls within their jurisdiction, a state, eligible interstate agency, or eligible tribe receives approximately $8,000. Alaska, Hawaii, and the territories are not included in the National Aquatic Resource Surveys but receive some of this funding for statistical survey projects. The requirements for receiving monitoring initiative funds are: Implementing a statistical survey design that provides condition estimates for a population of waters (e.g., streams, rivers, lakes, coastal waters, or wetlands) of the state based on an unbiased, representative sample of a subset of those waters. If they choose not to they must describe the program capacity development activities they are proposing and link them to their monitoring strategy. Participate in the national/regional scale surveys (which may just be agreement to receive in-kind assistance). Report the results of the states scale survey, preferably as a component of the states Integrated Report (narrative form) and/or in the probability survey module of ATTAINS.

To correct for bias , survey weights should be used. Statistically, the survey weights re-balance the dataset so that the sampled dataset represents the target population Sampling weights are intended to correct for systematic differences in probability sampling. Sampling weights, also known as survey weights, are positive values associated with the observations (rows) in your dataset (sample), used to ensure that metrics derived from a data set are representative of the population (the set of observations). Survey sampling is frequently used to reduce the cost or effort to survey an entire population. Surveying an entire population is called a census. Ideally, a sample is perfectly reflective of the population. However, this is often not the case due to various sources of sampling bias. Sampling weights are intended to correct for systematic differences in probability sampling. Why wouldnt a survey sample reflect the population it was drawn from? Some respondents are systematically less likely to respond to or participate in a survey. This is called the participation or non-response bias. Some segments of the population may not be included in a survey samples frame. A traditional example of this is seen in telephone surveys, they cannot access homes that do not have a telephone. This effect is called a coverage bias, or non-coverage. Some respondents may have a differing probability of being selected. An example of this would be a telephone survey where a household has more than one phone line. This is called selection bias. Certain individuals may be more likely to select themselves into a group, this is calledself-selection bias. Some sampling designs, such as stratified sampling or cluster sampling, can cause certain features to have a higher probability of selection than others. This can be set up so that key variables of interest (e.g., age, race, sex) are intentionally more selected (oversampled) to allow researchers to measure with more prediction changes in key populations. Sampling weights are intended to compensate for the selection of specific observations with unequal probabilities (oversampling), non-coverage, non-responses, and other types of bias. If a biased data set is not adjusted, population descriptors (e.g., mean, median) will be skewed and fail to correctly represent the populations proportion to the population. Statistically, the sampling weights re-balance the data set so that the sampled data set represents the target population as closely as reasonably possible. Sampling weights are often the reciprocalof the likelihood of being sampled (i.e., selection probability) of the sampling unit. For example, if you have selected 200 goldfish out of a population of 1000, the reciprocal of the likelihood of being selected is 1000/200, so the sampling weight for the goldfish would be 5. Sampling weights are important for survey data, particularly when calculating summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, or proportions). The relevance of using weights in data science models (e.g., linear or logistic regression modeling) is less clear, particularly when the models include controls for the variables used in weight construction. Ultimately, the decision to weight will depend on your sampling design, sampled data set, and industry knowledge of your use case. Your best friend for understanding how biases may be present in your data set will be performing data investigation. At a minimum, you should always include potential sources of bias (such as a non-response rate, or if key variables (e.g., income) are disproportionately represented as non-responses) in your reported findings. If you choose to use sampling weights in your analysis, document how your weights were derived and how they were applied.
